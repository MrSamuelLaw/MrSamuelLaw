- Hi, I’m @MrSamuelLaw  
I'm a controls engineer with a passion for programming. Most of the repos you'll find under my account are personal projects for automating things at my home lab. A few of the repos are for proof of concepts that I wanted to show off at work. And a minority of the repos are for projects I have done for school (I just recently went back to school), and want to keep for reference material.
